    <h1>Privacy Policy — Burq Todo</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-11-04</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Burq Todo stores task data only on the device. This app does not send your tasks or personal data to any server, third party, or analytics provider.</p>

    <h2>Data collected</h2>
    <p>No personal data is collected or transmitted by Burq Todo. Tasks and their completion state are saved locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>How data is stored</h2>
    <p>Task data is stored locally using the device's local storage (shared preferences). If you uninstall the app, local data may be removed by the system.</p>

    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <p>Burq Todo does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or trackers in the provided code. If third-party services are added later, this policy must be updated.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app does not require network permissions in its current form. Only local storage is used. If you add permissions later (e.g., cloud backup), update this policy and notify users.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This app is not designed specifically for children. If you believe your child provided personal information through the app, contact the developer below.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For privacy questions or requests, contact: <a href="mailto:support@your-domain.com">support@your-domain.com</a></p>

    <p style="font-size:0.9em; color:#555; margin-top:24px;">
      Note: This policy reflects the app code provided (local-only storage). If you add cloud sync, analytics, ads, or other services, update this policy before releasing the changed app.
